# Visual parity checklist

- [ ] Mbg rails displayed during dev; canvases align to rails.
- [ ] #glBg renders before .Mbg; per-section canvases mount inside .cCover.
- [ ] State classes (.stview/.inview/.act/.Ldd/.ivi) toggle identically.
- [ ] Timelines use manifest numbers; no inline numeric literals.
- [ ] Text handoff: `.char > .f/.n` present and animated.
